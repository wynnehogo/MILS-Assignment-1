The mini-ImageNet dataset is a smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, created to reduce the computational
complexity while retaining the essential properties of the larger dataset. It consists of 65,000 images from 50 different classes of animals.

# Task A: Designing a Convolution Module for Variable Input Channels
In order to reproduce the experiment for task A, run the following codes:
<br><br>
A. Running Baseline (ResNet18) 
<br>
1 ResNet18 Multiple Channels.py (for multiple channels such as RG, GB, RB, RGB)
<br>
1 ResNet18 Single Channel.py (for single channel such as R, G, B)
<br><br>
B. Running the Dynamic Convolutional Model 
<br>
1 Dyn Conv Multiple Channels.py (for multiple channels such as RG, GB, RB, RGB)
<br>
1 Dyn Conv Single Channel.py (for single channel such as R, G, B)
<br><br>
Codes are separated into 4 parts in order to reduce running time. 

# Task B: Designing a Two-Layer Network for Image Classification
In order to reproduce the experiment for task B, run the following codes:
<br><br>
2 Improved CNN.py (First Model)
<br>
2 Light GAP Net.py (Second Model)
<br>
2 Resnet34 Baseline.py (Baseline)
